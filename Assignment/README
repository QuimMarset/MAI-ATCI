To train the agents in the different environments the main.py has to be executed and follow the steps it asks on the prompt.
The same main.py allows testing the environment with the last executed experiment (i.e. the last experiment_x folder).

Also, the parameters can be changed in the constants.py file.
To change the ViZDoom game, the constant VIZDOOM must be changed to the name of one of the delivered .cfg files.

We also deliver a notebook (testing.ipynb) which contains the testing of all the environments with the different experiments we have performed
The parameter render controls if the environment is rendered or not. By default, it is set to False.
