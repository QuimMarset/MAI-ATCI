## Master in Artificial Intelligence - Reinforcement Learning - UPC

We uploaded the labs we did in the course, but the main part is the implementation project, where we had to implement a single-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, and evaluate its performance in several
environments.

We implemented Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and we evaluated it in 4 environments:
* Lunar Lander (Gym)
* Bipedal Walker (Gym)
* ViZDoom's Basic
* ViZDoom's Health Gathering

We include all the code we developed as well as the report explaining the implementation and the results.
